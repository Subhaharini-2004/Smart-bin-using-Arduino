Smart Bin with Ultrasonic Sensors and Arduino 

1.1 Introduction
The Smart bin project aims to revolutionize waste management by integrating ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor, a TM1637 display, and an Arduino Uno board. The incorporation of these components facilitates an automated and efficient waste disposal system.

1.2. Problem Statement
Traditional waste disposal methods often lack efficiency and environmental consciousness. Inefficient waste management leads to overflow, environmental pollution, and logistical issues in waste collection. Addressing these challenges requires an innovative solution that automates waste disposal while providing real-time monitoring of the bin's fill level.

1.3. Objectives
3.1. Primary Objective
- Develop a Smart bin system that automatically opens and closes its lid based on proximity detected by ultrasonic sensors and uses a servo motor for lid movement.
3.2. Secondary Objectives
- Implement a second ultrasonic sensor to determine the fill level of the bin and provide real-time information on a TM1637 display.
- Create an efficient power supply mechanism using a 5V battery for standalone operation.
- Ensure the system is user-friendly, reliable, and cost-effective.
1.4. System Components
4.1. Ultrasonic Sensors
- First Ultrasonic Sensor: Used for lid operation by measuring proximity and triggering the servo motor to open and close accordingly.
- Second Ultrasonic Sensor: Determines the fill level of the bin to prevent overflow.

4.2. Servo Motor
- Utilized to control the opening and closing of the bin lid by rotating at a specific angle (150 degrees).

4.3. TM1637 Display
- Displaying real-time information on the amount of waste-filled in the bin, ensuring easy monitoring.
4.4. Power Supply
- The 5V battery serves as an external power source, ensuring continuous and reliable operation.
